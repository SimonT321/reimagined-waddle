# X-Team 42 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

Volunteer first, and then if there are still assignments left then we will all talk about who is best suited to work on the task. If this fails the team leader will step in to help delegate tasks. 

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will keep in touch with each other on Thursdays at our weekly meetings. Additionally, we will set soft deadlines, so everyone is content with where we are in the program. We will use text and email to keep in touch throughout the week when we do not meet in person.
